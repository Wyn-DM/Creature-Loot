# Creature Loot
___


I loved the items that Jon Gazda made but I wanted to tweak them a bit. This is my edited version. The original can be found here [Creature Loot PDF](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L9zV7_eIrs3bqQ_cNd5).

### Basic Rules 
If a creature dies naturally or its body was found hours or days after death, it is up to the DM what items remain. Some items may have been already stolen, not remain on the creature after death, or have rotted beyond use.

If the players were fighting the creature and killed it in combat, they must make the appropriate check in order to claim the loot.
- Beast/Dragon/Monstrosity/Plant: Survival check
- Giant/Humanoid: Medicine check
- Celestial/Fey/Fiend/Undead: Religion check
- Aberration/Construct/Elemental/Ooze: Arcana check

This represents the type of knowledge required to successfully identify the valuable loot on the body.

##### Loot Claim Check 
|CR|DC (*all items*)|DC (*half items*)|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|<5|10|5|
|6-10|15|10|
|11-15|20|15|
|>16|25|20|

This represents the PCs ability to gather the items without harming them or hurting themselves. It might be difficult to harvest a demon heart when their blood is like acid and you just stabbed the fell beast a dozen times.

Beasts, Dragons, and Plants also provide a certain amount of rations:

<div style='margin-top:10px'></div>

##### Ration Amounts
|Size|Days of Rations (*1 person*)|
|:--|:-:|
|Tiny|1d6|
|Small|2d6|
|Medium|4d6|
|Large|4d10|
|Huge|8d12|
|Gargantuan|10d20|
\columnbreak
Some items are not usable until they have been crafted into a usable form. The following terms are used throughout the list:
___
***Minor Crafted.*** A PC or NPC must spend a number of hours equal to the creature's CR using the listed tools to create the new object. The crafter must be proficient in the listed tools. NPCs may charge gold for their services.
___
***Crafted.*** A PC or NPC must spend a number of days equal to the creature's CR using the listed tools to create the new object. The crafter must be proficient in the listed tools. NPCs may charge gold for their services.
___
***Carefully Crafted.*** A PC or NPC must spend a number of days equal to two times the creature's CR using the listed tools to create the new object. The crafter must be proficient in the listed tools or be a wizard studying the listed school of magic. NPCs may charge gold for their services.
___
***Mastercraft.*** Must be created by a PC or NPC who has dedicated themselves to the use of a particular tool or school of magic. For Wizard PCs, this means at least level 11. This is unlikely to be a PC, meaning they may have to carry the loot into a city to get it crafted. The crafter must spend a number of days equal to 6-10 times the creature's CR using the listed tools to create the new object. NPCs may charge gold for their services.
___

Certain items require Alchemist's Supplies to craft. If the item has a beneficial effect OR if the item is from a plant creature, it can also be crafted with proficiency in a Herbalism Kit. If the item has a malignant effect, it can also be crafted with proficiency in a Poisoner's Kit.

Some modifiers that will be applied to certain pieces of loot:
___
***Tattered.*** This item has been damaged as a result of its owner’s death. You will need to spend gold to repair it, equal to half the cost of a brand-new version of the item. (e.g. a tattered shield would cost 5GP to repair, since a new shield costs 10GP) Certain tattered items can be broken down to their basic components. A tattered shortsword need not be repaired; it could be used as a metal component in something else. If the players should bring back tattered items and choose to not repair them they get one quarter of the weight in pounds of whatever material it was. (e.g. a shortsword weighs 2lbs, they would get half a pound of raw metal)
___
***Vial.*** Any item described as a vial must be collected using a flask, vial, bottle, waterskin, or other liquid container. If a container is used to collect multiple different types of liquids, refer to the "Mixing Potions" table (DMG pg. 140)
___
***Treasure Hoard.*** Roll on the listed Treasure Hoard table (DMG pg. 137-139)
___
***In Lair.*** These items only appear if the creature is in its lair when it is fought, and the PCs have the time to search the lair after the fight. Depending on the type of lair, the DM may call for additional checks to find this treasure.

After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the disease can be removed only by Heal or another disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher.

### Solar (21) 
*Celestial (religion)*
___
- **1 Holy Greatsword.** Requires attunement. Acts as a magical greatsword that deals an additional 27 (6d8) radiant damage upon a hit. If wielded by a creature with a different alignment than the angel's creator, on a critical failure the weapon fuses to their body, triggering a horrific transformation that cannot be stopped except by a Wish spell.

- **1 Holy Longbow.** Requires attunement. Acts as a magical longbow that deals an additional 27 (6d8)  radiant damage upon a hit. If wielded by a creature with a different alignment than the angel's creator, on a critical failure the weapon fuses to their body, triggering a horrific transformation that cannot be stopped except by a Wish spell. The creature transforms into the original angel, who gains all its stats and abilities and has full hit points. The transformation takes 1d10 minutes, and kills the original creature.

If the spell is used to contact any extraplanar being other than the Solar's creator or patron God, the wearer must make a DC 20 Wisdom check. On a failure, the spell contacts the Solar's creator or patron God.
- **1 Head of a Solar.** The head continually whispers prayers of blood and vengeance. The creature who killed the solar can always hear these prayers, no matter what distance they are from the head or what measures are taken to stop the sound. After 1d6 days, a Planetar arrives at the killer's location to collect the head. If they do not have the head, the Planetar will become hostile. If killed, another will come in 1d6 days. If the killer has the head and gives it to the Planetar, the Planetar eats the head and gives up its body to resurrect the Solar. The Solar returns with full hit points and all its weapons and abilities. The Solar will then attempt to kill the creature who killed it. Looking into the eyes of the head causes an epileptic fit of faith in any creature who does not share the alignment of the Solar's creator. The fit lasts 1d4 hours and cannot be stopped except by a Wish spell or divine intervention. A creature may make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw to avert its gaze before looking directly into the eyes. The head can be traded for a major boon from a Lord of the Nine Hells. It can be used as a Holy Symbol and will double the effect of any hit points healed or damage dealt by a cleric spell cast by a cleric that shares an alignment with the Solar's creator. If the head is buried under a castle, the walls of that castle gain immunity to any damage dealt by any creature with a different alignment than the Solar's creator or patron God.
- **11 holy feathers.** Each acts as a Holy Symbol. When touched, they char the skin of any creature with an alignment different than the angel’s creator. Each can replace 500 GP of Diamonds for the material component of a Resurrection Spell.
- **2 Blessed Gauntlets.** Requires attunement. When worn together, the wielder gains a +1 bonus to AC, and they may cast Spare the Dying three times per day.
- **1 Sacred Robe.**  Requires attunement. Acts as padded armor.

In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest after 30 minutes of prayer, and the benefits of a long rest after 4 hours of prayer.

When the Demilich reforms, this item forcibly ends its attunement and returns to the Demilich. If the Phylactery is destroyed, these items crumble into useless dust.
- **1 Phylactery.** This item is not found with the Demilich unless the check made to loot the body was a 30 or higher.

On a successful save, the target takes 24 (7d6) necrotic damage, and if this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is trapped as if it failed the saving throw. If the soul is trapped, the soul is released when the gem is broken. If the soul is not trapped, the gem shatters upon use. When the Demilich reforms, all gems that have not been shattered return to the Demilich. If the Phylactery is destroyed, these items crumble into useless dust.

### Empyrean (23) 
*Celestial (religion)*
___
- **1 Divine Maul.** Requires Attunement Acts as a magical maul that changes size to fit its wielder. If wielded by a good-aligned creature, a creature struck by the maul must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the wielder’s next turn. The requirement changes to evil-aligned if the Empyrean was evil.
- **2 Eyes of the Empyrean.** Acts as a diamond worth 1,000 gp if used as the material component for a spell. Using it as a material component to cast Chromatic Orb allows the caster to choose Force damage or Radiant damage as the spell’s damage type. Can be mastercrafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a Potion of Truesight, which confers truesight out to 120 feet for 1 hour when consumed.
- **2 Hands of the Empyrean.** No immediate use. Together, they can be carefully crafted (carpenter’s tools or leatherworker’s tools) into a throne. A creature seated on the throne can understand all languages it hears, and can speak in any language. If a creature attunes to the throne, they gain proficiency on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks, as well as truesight out to 120 feet. Celestials are automatically hostile to a creature attuned to the throne. If the Empyrean was evil, the throne’s attunement counts as a curse, and the attuned creature’s alignment shift to Neutral Evil over the course of the next month.
- **4d4 Bones of the Empyrean.** Though obviously bone, counts as Adamantine in terms of hardness. Must be ground into powder before use. If consumed as an action, acts as the spell Lesser Restoration. If 10 are consumed together as an action, acts as the spell Greater Restoration. If 16 are consumed together as an action, acts as the spell Heal.
- **4d4 Chunks of Divine Flesh.** If consumed as an action, reduces the apparent age of a humanoid by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13 years old. This effect doesn’t extend the creature’s lifespan. For the remainder of the creature’s mortal life, their emotions manifest as a harmless, minor sensory Survival effect (similar to the Druidcraft spell) in a 5-foot cube they occupy. This imposes disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks if the creature is emotionally invested in the topic.
- **1 Titan’s Skull.** No immediate use. Though obviously bone, counts as Adamantine in terms of hardness. Can be mastercrafted (smith’s tools) into a set of half-plate or plate armor that requires attunement. While attuned to the armor, the wearer can use a bonus action to bolster all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet. Bolstered creatures can’t be charmed or frightened, and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of the wearer’s next turn. Once this property is used three times, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. While the creature is attuned to the armor, they slowly increase in size, as if affected by the Enlarge spell. The transformation takes place over 10 days, and the beneficial effects only manifest on the final day.
- **2d4 Locks of Divine Hair.** No immediate use. Can be crafted (weaver’s tools) into a charm that can be worn as a pendant, earring, or bracelet, and requires attunement. While attuned to the charm, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.
- **1 Immortal Heart.** Can be consumed as an action by a good-aligned humanoid, or an evil-aligned humanoid if the Empyrean was evil. For the remainder of the creature’s mortal life, they have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Additionally, they can no longer cast or be affected by Cleric or Paladin spells, and holy items cease to function while in contact or use by the creature. Celestials are automatically hostile to the creature, and the creature can still be affected by their Innate Spellcasting feature. If a creature is raised from the dead, they no longer retain this property.
- **3d2 Vials of Divine Blood.** Can be consumed as an action to grant immunity to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons for 1 minute.
- **1 God’s Trinket.** A small item from the upper planes. The DM rolls on the trinket table (PHB pg 160), and adds the following property to the item: while holding this item, a creature’s hit point maximum and current hit points increase by 5. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws made to avoid being the target of a Scrying spell originating from the Empyrean’s parent.
- **1 God’s Pendant.** Requires attunement. While attuned, the wearer may cast Commune once per day. If the spell is used to contact any extraplanar being other than the Empyrean’s parent, the wearer must make a DC 20 Wisdom check. On a failure, the spell contacts the Empyrean’s parent. An evil Empyrean does not carry a God’s Pendant.
- **2 Blessed/Cursed Gauntlets.** Requires attunement. When worn together, the wielder gains a +1 bonus to AC, and they may cast Spare the Dying three times per day. If the gauntlets are taken from an evil Empyrean, they cast Shocking Grasp instead.
- **1 Sacred Robe.** Acts as padded armor. If the wearer worships a god of the same alignment as the Empyrean’s parent, then the wearer does not need food, drink or sleep while wearing the armor.  In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest after 30 minutes of prayer, and the benefits of a long rest after 4 hours of prayer. An evil Empyrean’s robes lose all magical properties.
- **In Lair.** 6d10 Humanoids who are faithful to the Empyrean’s parent, or who serve an evil Empyrean out of fear

While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly transforms into a red slaad or, if it has the ability to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a green slaad. Only a wish spell can reverse the transformation. Once the sickle is used in this manner, it loses this property.
- **1 Control Gem.** No immediate use. Can be used to control the Slaad whose head it inhabits if removed by 9th level magic or careful surgery, without killing the Slaad. Can be crushed as a reaction to negate one roll on the Wild Magic Table.

- **1 Mane of the Sphinx.** No immediate use. Can be mastercrafted (weaver’s tools) into a crown that requires attunement. An attuned creature can cast Plane Shift once per day.

### Tarrasque (30) 
*Monstrosity (Survival)*

</div>

___
- **1 Heart of the Tarrasque.** Difficult to transport, as big as a large creature. No immediate use. Can be mastercrafted by a spellcaster (abjuration) into a Heart of Sorrow, which requires attunement and takes up two attunement slots. The Heart gains AC 15 and 50 hit points. If an attuned creature would take damage, and is on the same plane of existence as the Heart, it can choose to have the Heart of Sorrow take that damage instead. As long as the Heart of Sorrow has at least 1 hit point, it regains all lost hit points at dawn. The Heart shatters if it is reduced to 0 hit points. Can be mastercrafted (alchemist’s supplies) into 1d10 Potions of Tarrasque Strength (for 1 hour, your Strength score becomes 30. It has no effect if your Strength score is already 30 or higher).
- **1 Skull of the Tarrasque.** Difficult to transport, as big as a huge creature. The skull can be broken down into 40 Bones of the Tarrasque. Can be mastercrafted (woodcarver’s tools) into a ship. The ship’s bow has an AC of 25, the ship deals double damage to objects it rams, and if the bow of the ship would be targeted by a Magic Missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the spell bounces harmlessly off of the ship in a random direction. On a 6, the spell is reflected back at the caster as if the ship was the originator of the spell. Can be mastercrafted by a spellcaster (transmutation) into a throne. A creature who did not deal damage to the Tarrasque that attempts to sit on the throne is subject to a Flesh to Stone spell. The creature rolls its saving throws with disadvantage as long as it remains seated upon the throne. If a creature who has dealt damage to the Tarrasque sits upon the throne, they can harness the throne’s properties, all of which can be used once per day and refresh at dawn:
- *  All creatures within 120 feet of the throne must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours.
- *  If the creature sitting on the throne would fail a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
- *  If the creature sitting on the throne is targeted by a Magic Missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, they can choose for the spell to be reflected back upon the caster as if the throne was the originator of the spell.
- *  The creature sitting on the throne can make itself immune to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons for 10 minutes.
- **1 Ribcage of the Tarrasque.** Difficult to transport, as big as a gargantuan creature. The ribcage can be broken down into 80 Bones of the Tarrasque. Can be mastercrafted (mason’s tools) into the central pillar of a castle. The castle is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and doesn’t take double damage from creatures with the Siege Monster ability. Creatures who spend at least one night within the castle gain advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and immunity to the charmed and frightened condition. These effects last as long as they remain within the castle walls and linger for 1 hour once the creature leaves the castle. Can be mastercrafted by a spellcaster (conjuration/necromancy) into a wizard’s tower. Creatures summoned (conjuration) or created (necromancy) within the tower gain blindsight out to 60 feet, AC 25 from scaly armor that appears on them, and advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
- **1 Gullet of the Tarrasque.** Difficult to transport, as big as a medium creature. Acts as a tent that is immune to acid damage. The gullet can be broken down into 10 Hunks of Tarrasque Meat.

The bags are immune to acid damage and have resistance to bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage from nonmagical weapons.

Can be mastercrafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a potion of Acid Immunity (for 1 hour, the user is immune to acid damage).
- **4d20 Bones of the Tarrasque.** No immediate use. Can be mastercrafted (smith’s tools) into a +3 magical weapon (any marital melee weapon with the heavy property). A creature can’t wield the weapon effectively unless their Strength score is 18 or higher. The weapon deals double damage to objects and structures, and if it strikes a creature, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

___
- **4d20 Scales of the Tarrasque.** Acts as a shield. If a creature holding the shield is targeted by a Magic Missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a roll of a 6, the spell bounces harmlessly off of the shield in a random direction. 3 of these can be mastercrafted (smith’s tools) into magical +3 armor (any medium or heavy) that requires attunement. An attuned creature gains advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- **2d20 Horns of the Tarrasque.** Difficult to transport, as big as a large creature. No immediate use. Can be mastercrafted (carpenter’s tools) into a Battering Ram.

Can be mastercrafted by a spellcaster (enchantment) into 2d10 vials of Tarrasque Incense. When burned, the incense creates a 10-foot cloud of sweet-smelling smoke. A creature within this area must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The cloud persists for 1 minute or until dispersed by moderate or stronger winds.

The creature is grappled (escape DC 20) as long as the weapon or ammunition remains in place. The creature may choose to take the attack’s damage a second time to rip themselves free as a bonus action. Retrieving the weapon or ammunition also requires a DC 20 Strength check. On a failure, the weapon is permanently stuck in place, or the ammunition breaks and becomes nonmagical.
- **5d20 Hunks of Tarrasque Meat.** One hunk acts as a day’s worth of rations. If eaten this way, a creature gains immunity to being charmed or frightened for 24 hours.

### Troll (5)
*Giant (Medicine)*
___
- **2d4 Chunks of Troll Meat.** Can be consumed as rations. When eaten, the user must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. If a creature eats two half-chunks instead of one full chunk, the remainder of the two chunks regrows into two full chunks in 24 hours. This property doesn’t work (and the Constitution saving throw isn’t required) if the meat is cooked or cured in acid.
- **1 Vial of Troll Blood.** No immediate use. Can be carefully crafted (alchemist's supplies) into a Potion of Vitality. 
- **1d10 Troll Teeth.** 20 teeth act as a bag of caltrops. Can be carefully crafted (jeweler’s tools) into dice. Each day at dawn, roll 1d20. On an 11-19, the dice have grown into an interesting but unusable shape. On a 20, the dice have perfectly grown into a polyhedral die with one more side than it previously had.
- **1 Troll Limb.** Remains moving and attacks the nearest non-giant creature, per the Loathsome Limbs sidebar. If not cooked or cured with acid, regrows into a Troll in 1d4 hours. If dealt at least 10 acid or fire damage an hour, the regeneration process can be delayed. Dealing this damage doesn’t stop a short or long rest, provided the creature dealing the damage is awake to do so. Roll on the following table to determine the type of limb:

|d10|Result|
|:-:|:--|
|**1-2**|Head|
|**3-4**|Left Arm|
|**5-6**|Right Arm|
|**7-8**|Left Leg|
|**9-10**|Right Leg|

### Umber Hulk (5)
*Monstrosity (Survival)*
___
- **1d2 Umber Hulk Eyes.** No immediate use. Can be carefully crafted (enchantment) into an amulet that requires attunement. The amulet has a cover that prevents it from being seen. An attuned creature can magically open the eyelid-like cover, forcing creatures who can see the eye to make a saving throw against the eye’s effects. The eyelid can remain open for 10 rounds a day, after which it can’t be opened again until the next dawn. Crafting this item is hazardous, and each hour spent crafting, the creature crafting the item must make the Charisma saving throw, potentially harming creatures and objects around them.
- **2 Umber Hulk Claws.** No immediate use. Can be carefully crafted (smith’s tools) into a set of gauntlets. While worn, the gauntlets increase the damage of unarmed strikes to 1d8, and unarmed strikes deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning. The gauntlets have the heavy property.
- **1 Umber Hulk Carapace.** Acts as a shield. Can be carefully crafted (smith’s tools) into a set of plate armor.
- **1d2 Umber Hulk Antennae.** No immediate use. Can be carefully crafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a Potion of Tremorsense (grants Tremorsense to 60 feet for 1 hour).

\columnbreak

### Unicorn (5)
*Celestial (religion)*
___
- **1 Unicorn Horn.** Acts as a magical +2 dagger that requires attunement by a good creature. An attuned creature gains telepathy out to 60 feet and can cast Detect Evil and Good at will. If a creature successfully hits another creature with the horn as a melee attack, the attuned creature can choose to have the target regain hit points equal to the damage dealt instead of taking damage. Once this ability has healed 30 hit points, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
- **1 Unicorn Pelt.** Acts as a blanket that casts Calm Emotions on its user, preventing nightmares. Can be mastercrafted (leatherworker’s tools) into magical +3 leather armor that requires attunement by a good creature. An attuned creature gains advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Additionally, the creature may regain 11 (2d8+2) hit points as an action. Once sued, this ability can’t be used again until the attuned creature takes a short or long rest.
- **1d4 Unicorn Hooves.** Acts as a hammer. Can be carefully crafted (jeweler’s tools) into 1d6 dice. If the dice are rolled as a pair, they will always roll a total of 7. Can be mastercrafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a Potion of Supreme Healing.
- **2d10 Strands of Hair from a Unicorn’s Mane.** No immediate use. A creature can break the strand to cast Shield of Faith. 10 unbroken strands can be mastercrafted (weaver’s tools) into a bowstring. A creature struck by an arrow shot from a bow strung with this bowstring is subject to the Dismissal effect of a Dispel Evil and Good spell (save DC 14), provided the creature is of a type that would normally be affected by the spell. 20 unbroken strands can be mastercrafted (weaver’s tools) into a circlet. A creature wearing the circlet is affected by the Break Enchantment effect of a Dispel Evil and Good spell, provided they are under a condition that the spell would normally affect. The condition is not dismissed, only suppressed, and if the circlet is removed, the condition returns unless it was dispelled in the meantime.

### Vampire (13)
*Undead (religion)*
___
- **3d4 Vials of Vampire Dust.** If consumed as an action, acts as a Gaseous Form spell cast upon the user. Can be carefully crafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a Poison of Mist, an ingested poison that forces a target to become mist as in a Gaseous Form spell. When used this way, the spell does not require concentration and cannot be willingly ended before the full duration has passed.
- **2d4 Wisp of Shadow.** Destroyed if exposed to sunlight. 5 of these can be carefully crafted (conjuration) by a spellcaster into a Shadow Crossing, a portal that leads to the Shadowfell. The portal is permanently affixed to the location where it is crafted. 20 of these can be mastercrafted (transmutation) by a spellcaster into a Portable Hole.
- **2 Vampire Fangs.** Acts as a needle. Can be mastercrafted into a Potion of Vampirism. A creature drinking the potion takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces them to 0 hit points, then they are buried in the ground, they rise the following night as a Vampire Spawn. If the Vampire whose fang was used is still alive, the Spawn is under that Vampire’s control.
- **2 Vampire Eyes.** No immediate use. Can be carefully crafted by a spellcaster (enchantment) into an amulet that requires attunement. An attuned creature can cast Suggestion (DC 17) from the amulet three times. Once the third use has been expended, the amulet cannot be used again until the next sunset.
- **1 Vampire Heart.** This item is destroyed if the Vampire is killed while staked through the heart. Can be mastercrafted by a spellcaster (abjuration) into a suit of medium or heavy armor that requires attunement. While wearing the armor, an attuned creature regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn, as long as it has at least 1 hit point. The heart is exposed on the armor, and if it is in direct sunlight or the attuned creature takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of the attuned creature’s next turn. If a creature attacks the heart and pierces it with a wooden stake (AC 20 to hit), the armor loses this property and becomes mundane.
- **1d2 Vampire Hand.** Acts as a Crawling Claw that has all a Vampire’s weaknesses and the Spider Climb ability. If the Vampire is still alive, it is under the Vampire’s control. Otherwise, it acts independently. If killed, it can be carefully crafted by a spellcaster (divination) into a stand for a Crystal Ball. While held in the stand, the Crystal ball automatically succeeds on attempts to scry upon bats, rats, and wolves in the spell’s range, and gains the abilities of a Crystal Ball of Telepathy when viewing those creatures.
- **1 Vampire Head.** If not blessed by holy water, transforms into a Vargouille (Volo’s Guide pg. 195) in 1d4 days. Can be attuned to. An attuned creature can use an action to magically call 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, as long as the sun isn’t up. If outdoors, the attuned creature can call 3d6 wolves instead. The creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the attuned creature. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the attuned creature dismissed them as a bonus action, or if the creature loses its attunement. If the head transforms, the creature loses its attunement. The head can only be used to summon creatures once per day, and loses this property if blessed by holy water.
- **1 Tome of the Vampire.** Can be pickpocketed from the Vampire before death. Details how the Vampire was created and hints at where its resting place might be.

If the Vampire who created the original Vampire Spawn is still alive, the Spawn is under that Vampire’s control.
- **1 Vial of Vampire Dust.** If consumed as an action, acts as a Gaseous Form spell cast upon the user. Can be carefully crafted (alchemist’s supplies) into a Poison of Mist, an ingested poison that forces a target to become mist as in a Gaseous Form spell. When used this way, the spell does not require concentration and cannot be willingly ended before the full duration has passed.
- **2d4 Wisp of Shadow.** Destroyed if exposed to sunlight. 5 of these can be carefully crafted (conjuration) by a spellcaster into a Shadow Crossing, a portal that leads to the Shadowfell. The portal is permanently affixed to the location where it is crafted. 20 of these can be mastercrafted (transmutation) by a spellcaster into a Portable Hole.

On a failure, the undead becomes friendly to the attuned creature and obeys its commands until this ability is used again. ***Curse:*** an attuned creature takes on a semi-incorporeal appearance. The creature is vulnerable to radiant damage, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as Wisdom (perception) checks that rely on sight, while in sunlight. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points while attuned to the crown, it dies immediately, without making death saving throws.
